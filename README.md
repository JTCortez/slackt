This project will be developed by the group SLACKTULATOR (The first letter of our first and last names used). Our project will be covering the course project topic 3: An electrical calculator.

This software simulates a calculator that is capable of commonly used computations, including
but not limited to basic arithmetic calculations. Computing with real numbers need to be
supported, allowing users to control the level of precision desired (e.g., precise up to four
decimal places). Some advanced computations could also be supported, such as power, root,
triangular calculations, and so on.
